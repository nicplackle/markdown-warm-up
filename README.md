## Analyzing Website: 
### Lay-out
* Homepage (index) is unclear what it is about
* Color font resembles the background color too much
* Ugly buttons
* Ugly pictures
* Navigation could be in a bar on top 
* Not viewable on mobile devices (website is in fixed container, does not adapt to screen size)

### Code
* Made with a template from [Website X5](https://www.website5.com) They never updated the template since 06.10.2017)
* Static/semantic website, while [Website X5](https://www.websitex5.com) uses a dynamic cms system
* The links 'uitklappen' and 'inklappen' don't work


### Content
* Negative info on 'Wie zijn wij?' page (copywriting not ok)
* E-mail address is not hidden from spambots
* Address not linked to Google Maps
* Active on social media but no link to the page

### 3 Most important changes:
* Lay-out: Most info could be put on the homepage
* No social media link
